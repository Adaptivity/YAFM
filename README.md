Yet Another Food Mod for Minecraft.

Adds some more food to the game.  Yeah yeah, it's been done before, just not by me.

Tested with Minecraft Forge version 9.11.1.916.

Compiling
---------

I don't like Eclipse, so here's a step-by-step for how to build this by hand.

Dependencies: JDK, JRE.

1. Add JDK\bin and JRE\bin to your PATH.
2. Download the "src" version of Minecraft Forge from http://files.minecraftforge.net (tested with 9.11.1.916).
3. Extract "forge" somewhere, and navigate there.
4. Run "install.cmd" or "install.sh".
5. Navigate to the "mcp" directory.
6. From this repository, copy the contents of "source" into "src/minecraft".  Sanity check: there should be a "src/minecraft/airbreather/mods/yafm" folder now.
7. From this repository, copy the contents of "modules/airbreathercore/source" into "src/minecraft".  Sanity check: there should be a "src/minecraft/airbreather/mods/airbreathercore" folder now.
8. Run "recompile.bat" or "recompile.sh".
9. When that completes, run "reobfuscate.bat" or "reobfuscate.sh".
10. Navigate to the "reobf/minecraft" directory.
11. From this repository, copy the "assets" folder to this folder.  Sanity check: starting from the "mcp" directory, there should be a "reobf/minecraft/assets/yafm" directory now.
12. Zip up everything in here and name the resulting file "yafm-0.2.0.jar".
13. Optionally, also add to that zip file the loose files provided in the root of this repository (excluding git-related hidden files and this README.md).
