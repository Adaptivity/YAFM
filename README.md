YAFM
====

Yet Another Food Mod for Minecraft.

Adds some more food to the game.  Yeah yeah, it's been done before, just not by me.

Tested with Minecraft Forge version 9.11.1.965.

Compiling
---------

I don't like Eclipse, so here's a step-by-step for how to build this by hand.

Dependencies: JDK, JRE, Gradle (tested with 1.10).

Once
----
1. Set the GRADLE_HOME environment variable to wherever you installed Gradle (the folder that contains bin, init.d, lib, etc.).
2. Add JDK\bin, JRE\bin, and GRADLE_HOME\bin to your PATH.
3. Navigate to the YAFM source tree.
4. Run "gradle setupDevWorkspace".

Every time
----------
1. Navigate to the YAFM source tree.
2. Run "gradle build".
3. The result will be in the "build\libs".
